# MSX PicoVerse 2350 LoadROM Tool Manual (EN-US)

The PicoVerse 2350 LoadROM tool creates a UF2 image that flashes the PicoVerse 2350 with a single ROM payload and the LoadROM firmware or with dedicated standalone sound-cartridge firmware variations.

`loadrom.exe` bundles the Pico firmware blob, a configuration record (game name, mapper code, ROM size, and flash offset), and one MSX ROM file into an RP2350-compatible UF2 image. Copy the generated UF2 to the board in BOOTSEL mode and the MSX will boot straight into the embedded ROM.

For RP2350, the current LoadROM package is:

- `2350/software/loadrom.pio`.

> **Important:** SCC/SCC+ emulation options (`-scc`, `-sccplus`), the secondary AY-3-8910 dual PSG option (`-d`), and the MSX-MUSIC/YM2413 option (`-f` or `-fmpac`) are supported by the current RP2350 LoadROM package (`2350/software/loadrom.pio`). Exactly one on-cartridge audio mode can be active per UF2 image.

> **OPL4 / MoonSound:** The `-4` / `--opl4` option builds a dedicated, standalone OPL4 / YMF278B / MoonSound cartridge instead of a ROM loader. It is mutually exclusive with every other mode and does not take a ROM file. See [Standalone OPL4 / MoonSound cartridge](#standalone-opl4--moonsound-cartridge).

> **MSX-AUDIO / Y8950:** The `-a` / `--msx-audio` option builds a dedicated, standalone MSX-AUDIO (Yamaha Y8950) cartridge instead of a ROM loader. It is mutually exclusive with every other mode and does not take a ROM file. See [Standalone MSX-AUDIO / Y8950 cartridge](#standalone-msx-audio--y8950-cartridge).

## Overview

1. **Input**: one `.ROM` file (case-insensitive extension).
2. **Processing**: the tool normalizes the ROM name, detects or forces the mapper, and streams firmware + config + ROM into UF2 blocks.
3. **Output**: a UF2 file (default `loadrom.uf2`) ready for the RP2350 bootloader.

Key characteristics:

- Windows console application.
- Supports ROM sizes from 8 KB up to 16 MB (subject to flash capacity).
- Mapper auto-detection plus optional filename tags to force the mapper.
- Embedded SHA-1 database derived from openMSX `softwaredb.xml` for improved mapper identification.
- Built-in Sunrise IDE Nextor ROM for standalone Nextor boot or Nextor + 1MB PSRAM mapper, using either the on-board microSD card (`-s1`/`-m1`) or a USB flash drive (`-s2`/`-m2`).
- Built-in Nextor + 1MB mapper + 1MB MegaRAM system images, using either microSD (`-r1`) or USB mass storage (`-r2`).
- Optional ESP-01 WiFi support for those Sunrise IDE modes via `-w`, adding an embedded ESP8266P system ROM and memio UART backend.
- ROM loading into the 1MB PSRAM mapper through Carnivore2-compatible RAM emulation for `SROM.COM /D15`, using either microSD (`-c1`) or USB mass storage (`-c2`) as the Nextor backend.
- Standalone sound-cartridge firmware builds that embed no game ROM: OPL4 / YMF278B / MoonSound (`-4`) with the 2 MB YRW801-M wave ROM, and MSX-AUDIO / Y8950 (`-a`) with the 48 KB MSX-Audio BIOS.
- UF2 uses RP2350 family ID (`0xE48BFF59`).

## Command-line usage

```
loadrom.exe [options] [romfile]
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help` : Print usage information and exit.
- `-s1`, `--sunrise-sd` : Build a UF2 with the embedded Sunrise IDE Nextor ROM using the on-board microSD card slot for storage. No external ROM file is needed.
- `-m1`, `--mapper-sd` : Same as `-s1` plus a 1MB memory mapper (64 × 16KB pages) backed by external PSRAM on GPIO47 / QMI CS1 in an expanded sub-slot architecture. No external ROM file is needed.
- `-s2`, `--sunrise-usb` : Build a UF2 with the embedded Sunrise IDE Nextor ROM using the cartridge's USB-C port for storage (USB mass storage). No external ROM file is needed.
- `-m2`, `--mapper-usb` : Same as `-s2` plus a 1MB memory mapper (64 × 16KB pages) backed by external PSRAM on GPIO47 / QMI CS1 in an expanded sub-slot architecture. No external ROM file is needed.
- `-c1`, `--carnivore2-sd` : Build a UF2 with Sunrise IDE Nextor on microSD plus the 1MB PSRAM mapper and Carnivore2 RAM-mode emulation for `SROM.COM /D15`. In this mode, `SROM.COM` can upload a ROM image into the PSRAM-backed mapper and launch it from RAM without reflashing the cartridge.
- `-c2`, `--carnivore2-usb` : Same as `-c1`, but uses USB mass storage on the cartridge's USB-C port as the Nextor backend.
- `-r1`, `--megaram-sd` : Build a UF2 with Sunrise IDE Nextor on microSD, a 1MB MSX memory mapper, and a separate 1MB PSRAM-backed MegaRAM subslot using 128 × 8KB banks. No external ROM file is needed.
- `-r2`, `--megaram-usb` : Same as `-r1`, but uses USB mass storage on the cartridge's USB-C port as the Nextor backend.
- `-w`, `--wifi` : Enable ESP-01 WiFi support for `-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, or `-m2`. This adds the ESP8266P system ROM plus a memory-mapped UART backend expected by the WiFi ROM/software stack.
- `-scc`, `--scc` : Enable SCC (standard) sound emulation. For embedded ROM builds, this applies to Konami SCC or Manbow2 mapper ROMs. With `-c1` or `-c2`, it enables SCC playback for Konami SCC ROMs uploaded later through `SROM.COM /D15`.
- `-sccplus`, `--sccplus` : Enable SCC+ (enhanced) sound emulation. For embedded ROM builds, this applies to Konami SCC or Manbow2 mapper ROMs. With `-c1` or `-c2`, it enables SCC+ playback for compatible ROMs uploaded later through `SROM.COM /D15`.
- `-d`, `--dual-psg` : Enable secondary AY-3-8910 (PSG) emulation on I/O ports `0x10` (register select) and `0x11` (data). The Pico captures `OUT (0x10/0x11),A` writes via PIO1 and streams a mixed signal to the I2S DAC alongside the host MSX's PSG. Only valid with external ROM files whose mapper is not Konami SCC or Manbow2 (those mappers carry an on-cartridge SCC chip and reserve the second audio slot for SCC emulation).
- `-f`, `-fmpac` : Enable MSX-MUSIC / YM2413 emulation on I/O ports `0x7C` (register select) and `0x7D` (data). The Pico captures OPLL writes via PIO1 and streams the generated FM audio to the I2S DAC. The UF2 also embeds the FM-PAC BIOS and exposes it in an expanded FM-PAC subslot so ROMs that use MSX-MUSIC BIOS calls can find it. Only valid with non-SYSTEM external ROM files.
- `-4`, `--opl4` : Build a dedicated, standalone OPL4 / YMF278B / MoonSound cartridge. This is **not** a ROM loader: the UF2 contains only the OPL4 firmware and the 2 MB YRW801-M wave ROM, turning the cartridge into a MoonSound-compatible sound device (2 MB wave ROM + 2 MB PCM sample RAM) on the standard MoonSound I/O ports. It does not take a ROM file and is mutually exclusive with every other option.
- `--opl4-limit` : With `-4` / `--opl4`, enable the adaptive PCM voice limiter. Core 1 measures its own per-buffer fill time and temporarily caps how many of the 24 PCM voices are rendered, preventing audio underrun on extreme-polyphony songs. Off by default (full fidelity).
- `--lowclock` : With `-4` / `--opl4`, build an OPL4 image that runs the RP2350 at 282 MHz instead of the default 300 MHz.
- `-a`, `--msx-audio` : Build a dedicated, standalone MSX-AUDIO / Yamaha Y8950 cartridge. This is **not** a ROM loader: the UF2 contains only the MSX-AUDIO firmware and the 48 KB MSX-Audio BIOS, turning the cartridge into an MSX-AUDIO card (OPL1 FM + ADPCM, 256 KB ADPCM sample RAM) on ports `0xC0`/`0xC1`. It does not take a ROM file and is mutually exclusive with every other option.
- `--4mhz` : With `-a` / `--msx-audio`, clock the emulated Y8950 at 4 MHz instead of the standard 3.579545 MHz, raising the output rate from 49716 Hz to 55555 Hz.
- `-o <filename>`, `--output <filename>` : Override the UF2 output name (default `loadrom.uf2`).
- Positional argument: the ROM file to embed. Required for normal ROM loading; not accepted with `-s1`/`-m1`/`-s2`/`-m2`/`-c1`/`-c2`/`-r1`/`-r2`.

`-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, `-m2`, `-c1`, `-c2`, `-r1`, and `-r2` are mutually exclusive. `-w` is valid only with `-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, or `-m2`. The audio options `-scc`, `-sccplus`, `-d`, and `-f`/`-fmpac` are mutually exclusive — only one on-cartridge audio engine can be active per UF2 image. `-d` is additionally rejected for Konami SCC and Manbow2 ROMs, while `-d` and `-f`/`-fmpac` are rejected for the embedded Sunrise/Carnivore2/MegaRAM system modes. `-f`/`-fmpac` is also rejected for Konami SCC and Manbow2 mapper ROMs. If conflicting options are provided, the tool exits with an error.

`-4`/`--opl4` is fully standalone: it cannot be combined with any other option (no Sunrise/Carnivore2 mode, no audio flag, no `-w`, and no ROM file). If `-4` is mixed with any of those, the tool exits with an error. `--opl4-limit` and `--lowclock` are only accepted together with `-4`.

`-a`/`--msx-audio` is fully standalone in the same way, and is also mutually exclusive with `-4`/`--opl4`. `--4mhz` is only accepted together with `-a`.

For the firmware architecture behind `-d`, see the [PicoVerse 2350 Dual PSG implementation guide](./msx-picoverse-2350-dualpsg.md).

For the firmware architecture behind `-r1` / `-r2`, see the [PicoVerse 2350 MegaRAM implementation guide](./msx-picoverse-2350-megaram.md).

When `-f` or `-fmpac` is selected, LoadROM keeps the selected game mapper active and adds the FM-PAC BIOS/register area in the cartridge's expanded slot layout. The Pico responds to both direct YM2413 I/O writes and FM-PAC memory-mapped register writes at `0x7FF4`/`0x7FF5`.

For the firmware architecture behind `-f` / `-fmpac`, see the [PicoVerse 2350 MSX-MUSIC / FM-PAC implementation guide](./msx-picoverse-2350-fmpac.md).

### Standalone OPL4 / MoonSound cartridge

The `-4` / `--opl4` option produces a firmware-only UF2 that turns the PicoVerse 2350 into a dedicated **OPL4 (Yamaha YMF278B) / MoonSound** sound cartridge. Unlike every other LoadROM mode, it does not embed an MSX ROM and does not load any game — the cartridge is purely a MoonSound-compatible sound device.

What the cartridge provides:

- Full **YMF278B**: OPL3 FM (18 channels) plus the 24-voice PCM wavetable engine.
- The **2 MB YRW801-M** wave ROM (embedded in the UF2) and **2 MB of PCM sample RAM** in external PSRAM, presented as the standard 4 MB OPL4 PCM address space (`0x000000`-`0x1FFFFF` wave ROM, `0x200000`-`0x3FFFFF` sample RAM).
- The standard MoonSound host I/O ports: `0x7E`/`0x7F` (wavetable) and `0xC4`–`0xC7` (FM).
- 16-bit stereo audio at 44.1 kHz through the on-cartridge I2S DAC.
- FM timer interrupts delivered on the MSX `/INT` line (GPIO40, open-drain) so MoonBlaster / MBWAVE style replayers keep the correct song tempo.

Implementation notes:

- Synthesis uses the BSD-3 licensed [`ymfm`](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) YMF278B core. Core 1 runs the synthesis loop into the I2S producer pool while Core 0 owns the MSX bus (PIO port decode, `/WAIT`-gated reads, `/BUSDIR` drive, and register write capture).
- The firmware is linked `copy_to_ram` and the RP2350 is overclocked to **300 MHz**, with the QMI flash/PSRAM dividers raised in step so the memory devices keep their tuned timing. `--lowclock` builds the same firmware at 282 MHz.
- Sample RAM is written through the wavetable memory-access registers (`0x02`-`0x06`), so sample uploaders such as SETOPL4 work unchanged.
- `--opl4-limit` enables the adaptive PCM voice limiter for extreme-polyphony homebrew songs; light passages remain bit-identical, and FM channels are never capped because they carry the tempo interrupt.

Because `-4` is standalone, it cannot be combined with any Sunrise/Carnivore2 mode, any other audio flag (`-scc`, `-sccplus`, `-d`, `-f`/`-fmpac`), `-a`/`--msx-audio`, `-w`, or a ROM file. The only other accepted options are `-o` to rename the output, `--opl4-limit`, and `--lowclock`.

Usage:

```
loadrom.exe -4                          # writes loadrom.uf2
loadrom.exe -4 -o moonsound.uf2         # custom output name
loadrom.exe -4 --opl4-limit -o moonsound-limit.uf2
loadrom.exe -4 --lowclock -o moonsound-282.uf2
```

Flash the resulting UF2 in BOOTSEL mode, then use any MoonSound software on the MSX — for example MoonTest (detection and RAM test), SETOPL4 (sample upload/playback), and MoonBlaster / MBWAVE (music playback). No microSD, USB drive, or ESP-01 is required for this mode.

For the full firmware architecture, see the [PicoVerse 2350 OPL4 / MoonSound implementation guide](./msx-picoverse-2350-opl4.md).

### Standalone MSX-AUDIO / Y8950 cartridge

The `-a` / `--msx-audio` option produces a firmware-only UF2 that turns the PicoVerse 2350 into a dedicated **MSX-AUDIO** cartridge built around an emulated **Yamaha Y8950**. Like `-4`, it does not embed an MSX ROM and does not load any game. Unlike `-4`, it is **not** a pure I/O device: a real MSX-AUDIO card also exposes a memory-mapped BIOS plus work RAM, so the cartridge answers both memory and I/O cycles.

What the cartridge provides:

- An emulated **Yamaha Y8950**: OPL1 FM (9 channels) plus the ADPCM-B / delta-T sample engine.
- **256 KB of ADPCM sample RAM** in external PSRAM.
- The **MSX-Audio BIOS v1.3** (NMS-1205, 48 KB) embedded in the UF2 and exposed in the cartridge slot.
- Host ports `0xC0` (register select on write, status on read) and `0xC1` (data).
- 16-bit audio at **49716 Hz**, the Y8950 native rate (no resampling), at unity gain through the I2S DAC.
- Y8950 FM timer interrupts on the MSX `/INT` line (GPIO40, open-drain) and `/BUSDIR` driven during port reads.

The slot memory map is shown below. The MSX-Audio BIOS is mirrored three times in the 64 KB slot, and the base work RAM is mirrored once. The expanded work RAM is mirrored once, and the unmapped range reads as `0xFF`:

| Z80 range | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `0x0000`-`0x2FFF` | MSX-Audio BIOS |
| `0x3000`-`0x3FFF` | Base work RAM (4 KB) |
| `0x4000`-`0x6FFF` | MSX-Audio BIOS (`AB` header at `0x4000`) |
| `0x7000`-`0x7FFF` | Base work RAM mirror |
| `0x8000`-`0xAFFF` | MSX-Audio BIOS |
| `0xB000`-`0xBFFF` | Expanded work RAM (4 KB) |
| `0xC000`-`0xEFFF` | Unmapped — reads `0xFF` |
| `0xF000`-`0xFFFF` | Expanded work RAM mirror |

Implementation notes:

- Synthesis uses the BSD-3 licensed [`ymfm`](https://github.com/aaronsgiles/ymfm) `y8950` core, separate from the OPL4 firmware's copy.
- The design is **single-owner on Core 0**: one loop drains memory writes, drains I/O writes, services one read, generates one audio sample into a lock-free ring, and migrates one ROM chunk to SRAM. Core 1 only feeds the I2S DAC from the ring, so status and ADPCM sample-RAM reads are always exact.
- The UF2 layout is `[msxaudio firmware][16-byte "PVAU" config header][48 KB MSX-Audio BIOS]`. Byte 4 of the header carries the flags, with bit 0 = 4 MHz Y8950 clock.
- `--4mhz` raises the emulated Y8950 clock to 4 MHz; because every Y8950 rate derives from the sample clock, this is implemented by raising the output rate to 55555 Hz.
- The cartridge is not an expanded slot, so `0xFFFF` behaves as ordinary work RAM, which is how the MSX BIOS concludes the slot is not expanded.

Because `-a` is standalone, it cannot be combined with `-4`/`--opl4`, any Sunrise/Carnivore2/MegaRAM mode, any other audio flag (`-scc`, `-sccplus`, `-d`, `-f`/`-fmpac`), `-w`, or a ROM file. The only other accepted options are `-o` to rename the output and `--4mhz`.

Usage:

```
loadrom.exe -a                          # writes loadrom.uf2
loadrom.exe -a -o msxaudio.uf2          # custom output name
loadrom.exe -a --4mhz -o msxaudio4.uf2  # 4 MHz Y8950 clock
```

Flash the resulting UF2 in BOOTSEL mode, then use any MSX-AUDIO software — the BIOS itself, MSX-AUDIO games, ADPCM sample players, and FM/ADPCM replayers. No microSD, USB drive, or ESP-01 is required for this mode.

### Mapper forcing via filename tags

Append a dot-separated mapper tag before the `.ROM` extension to override detection. Tags are case-insensitive.

Supported tags:
`PLA-16`, `PLA-32`, `KonSCC`, `PLN-48`, `PLN-64`, `ASC-08`, `ASC-16`, `ASC-16X`, `ASC16X-FR`, `Konami`, `NEO-8`, `NEO-16`, `MANBW2`.

Additional aliases are accepted for backward compatibility: `PL-16`, `PL-32`, `PL-48`, `PL-64`, `PLN-32`, `PLANAR`, `LINEAR`, `LINEAR0`, `PLANAR48`, `PLANAR64`, `ASC16X`, `ASC-16X-FR`, `MANBOW2`, `MBW-2`.

Example:

```
Penguin Adventure.PL-32.ROM
Space Manbow.KonSCC.rom
Go Figure.ASC16X-FR.rom
```

Tags are case-insensitive. If no valid tag is present, the tool first computes the ROM's SHA-1 hash and looks it up in an embedded database derived from the openMSX `softwaredb.xml`. When a match is found the database mapper type is used directly. Otherwise the tool falls back to heuristic detection.

`SYSTEM` is ignored and cannot be forced.

### ASCII16-X with FlashROM (`ASC16X-FR`)

ASCII16-X cartridges carry a real FlashROM chip, and the mapper specification lets software erase sectors and program bytes so a game can store save games, high scores or user created levels inside the cartridge itself.

Auto-detection is deliberately unchanged: a ROM recognised as ASCII16-X is always built as the read-only variant, where flash command sequences are ignored. FlashROM emulation is opt-in through the `ASC16X-FR` filename tag:

```
loadrom.exe "Go Figure.ASC16X-FR.rom" -o gofigure.uf2
```

This is the same tag the Explorer tool uses, so a ROM tagged for one tool behaves the same way in the other.

With the tag, the cartridge implements the command set the specification names as the guaranteed minimum — autoselect, CFI query, chip erase, sector erase and byte program — plus the software reset. Sector geometry follows the documented bottom-boot layout: eight 8 KB sectors followed by 64 KB sectors.

The flash contents are mirrored to a file named after the ROM in the root of the microSD card:

```
/<ROM name>.FLA
```

The file has no header: it is a byte exact image of the cartridge flash, so it can be copied off the card and inspected, or used as a ROM image. It is matched to the running cartridge by name and size.

Notes:
- The image is created in full the first time the cartridge runs with a card that has no matching `.FLA`, and restored at start-up on later runs. Both happen before the MSX is released, so expect a short pause on a large cartridge.
- Without a usable microSD card the flash is still emulated, but its contents are lost at power off.
- The emulated device is sized to the next power of two at or above the ROM size, up to 8 MB.
- Combining the tag with `-d` (second PSG) keeps the flash emulation working but makes it volatile, because the PSG engine owns the core that writes the card. The tool warns when this happens.

4. Review the console output (name, size, mapper, and flash offset).
5. Hold BOOTSEL while connecting the PicoVerse 2350 to USB.
6. Copy the generated UF2 to the `RPI-RP2` drive.
7. Insert the cartridge into the MSX and power on.
8. For `-s1`/`-m1`/`-r1` modes, insert a FAT-formatted microSD card into the cartridge's microSD slot before powering the MSX.
9. For `-s2`/`-m2`/`-r2` modes, connect a USB flash drive (via OTG adapter if needed) to the cartridge's USB-C port before powering the MSX.
10. For `-w` builds, install the ESP-01 module on the PicoVerse 2350 before power-up. The WiFi system ROM and memio UART interface are then available to compatible MSX software.
11. For `-c1`/`-c2` modes, boot Nextor first and then use `SROM.COM /D15` to upload the ROM into the PicoVerse PSRAM mapper. The cartridge is presented as a Carnivore2-compatible RAM target so the uploaded ROM can be launched directly from RAM.
12. For `-r1`/`-r2` modes, boot Nextor first and use a MegaRAM-aware loader or workflow that enables writes with `IN (0x8E)` or `IN (0x8F)`, loads data into the MegaRAM banks, disables writes with `OUT (0x8E)` or `OUT (0x8F)`, and launches software from the MegaRAM subslot.

## Output layout details

The UF2 image contains:

1. **Firmware blob** – embedded `loadrom` firmware.
2. **Configuration record** (59 bytes):
   - 50 bytes: ROM name (ASCII, padded/truncated).
   - 1 byte : mapper ID plus optional audio/WiFi flags. Normal ROM mapper IDs use the low nibble; embedded system modes use base IDs 10, 11, and 15-20 after the firmware masks off option flags:
     - Bit 7 (`0x80`) = SCC emulation enabled.
     - Bit 6 (`0x40`) = SCC+ emulation enabled.
     - Bit 5 (`0x20`) = WiFi support enabled for Sunrise IDE modes, or MSX-MUSIC/YM2413 enabled for non-SYSTEM ROMs.
     - Bit 4 (`0x10`) = Dual PSG emulation enabled (secondary AY-3-8910 on ports `0x10`/`0x11`).
   - 4 bytes: ROM size (little-endian).
   - 4 bytes: ROM flash offset (little-endian).
3. **ROM payload** – raw ROM data appended after the config record.

The UF2 writer sets `UF2_FLAG_FAMILYID_PRESENT` and uses the RP2350 family ID (`0xE48BFF59`) so the bootloader accepts the image.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Possible cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Invalid ROM size" | ROM < 8 KB or > 16 MB | Use a valid ROM size. |
| "Failed to detect the ROM type" | Mapper heuristics failed | Add a mapper tag (e.g., `.Konami.ROM`). |
| "Sunrise options are mutually exclusive" | More than one of `-s1`/`-m1`/`-s2`/`-m2`/`-c1`/`-c2`/`-r1`/`-r2` passed | Use only one firmware mode at a time. The `-m` variants add mapper RAM; the `-c` variants add Carnivore2 RAM-mode loading; the `-r` variants add a separate MegaRAM subslot. |
| "Sunrise options do not accept an external ROM file" | ROM file passed with a Sunrise/Carnivore2/MegaRAM option | Remove the ROM file argument when using `-s1`/`-m1`/`-s2`/`-m2`/`-c1`/`-c2`/`-r1`/`-r2`. |
| "Error: -w/--wifi is supported only with -s1, -m1, -s2 or -m2" | `-w` was used without a supported Sunrise mode | Pair `-w` only with `-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, or `-m2`. |
| USB pendrive not detected with `-s2`/`-m2`/`-r2` | VBUS not connected or no OTG adapter | Ensure the USB-C port has VBUS power (use an OTG adapter that supplies VBUS). |
| microSD card not detected with `-s1`/`-m1`/`-r1` | Card not inserted or not FAT-formatted | Insert a FAT16/FAT32-formatted microSD card before powering on. |
| WiFi software does not detect the adapter with `-w` | Missing ESP-01 module, incompatible ESP firmware, or wrong WiFi-capable UF2 | Reflash a `-w` build, verify the ESP-01 is installed, and use software targeting the ESP8266P memio interface. |
| `SROM.COM /D15` does not list the cartridge with `-c1`/`-c2` | Wrong firmware mode or outdated build | Reflash with the correct `-c1` or `-c2` UF2 and use a build that includes Carnivore2 RAM-mode emulation. |
| `SROM.COM /D15` upload succeeds but the launched ROM fails | ROM/runtime compatibility issue in the emulation path | Try the latest firmware build and retest; this mode depends on Carnivore2-compatible bank/window presentation from PSRAM. |
| "Disk driver not found. System halted." with `-m1`/`-m2` | Firmware issue | Rebuild with latest firmware; check that the PIO bus init guard is present. |
| "Warning: -scc flag ignored" | ROM is not Konami SCC or Manbow2 mapper, or the selected Nextor mode is not `-c1`/`-c2` | Use a Konami SCC or Manbow2 ROM, or pair `-scc` with `-c1`/`-c2` for SROM-loaded Konami SCC titles. |
| "Warning: -sccplus flag ignored" | ROM is not Konami SCC or Manbow2 mapper, or the selected Nextor mode is not `-c1`/`-c2` | Use a compatible ROM, or pair `-sccplus` with `-c1`/`-c2` for SROM-loaded SCC+ titles. |
| "Error: -scc and -sccplus are mutually exclusive" | Both options were passed together | Use only one of the two options. |
| `-4`/`--opl4` rejected or errors out | `-4` was combined with another mode, an audio flag, `-a`, `-w`, or a ROM file | Use `-4` (optionally with `-o`, `--opl4-limit`, or `--lowclock`) on its own; it is a standalone MoonSound build and accepts no other options or ROM file. |
| MoonSound software does not detect the cartridge with `-4` | Wrong UF2 or board without the OPL4 audio/`/INT` wiring | Reflash a `-4` build and use a PicoVerse 2350 with the I2S DAC and `/INT` (GPIO40) connected. |
| Broken/harsh audio on extreme-polyphony MoonSound songs with `-4` | Synthesis throughput shortfall (most FM channels plus most PCM voices at once) | Rebuild with `loadrom.exe -4 --opl4-limit` to enable the adaptive PCM voice limiter. |
| `-a`/`--msx-audio` rejected or errors out | `-a` was combined with another mode, an audio flag, `-4`, `-w`, or a ROM file | Use `-a` (optionally with `-o` or `--4mhz`) on its own; it is a standalone MSX-AUDIO build and accepts no other options or ROM file. |
| "Option --4mhz requires -a/--msx-audio" | `--4mhz` used without `-a` | Add `-a` / `--msx-audio`, or drop `--4mhz`. |
| MSX-AUDIO software does not detect the cartridge with `-a` | Wrong UF2 or board without the audio/`/INT` wiring | Reflash an `-a` build and use a PicoVerse 2350 with the I2S DAC and `/INT` (GPIO40) connected. |
| MSX-AUDIO music plays at the wrong tempo or hangs with `-a` | Replayer paced by the Y8950 FM timer interrupt | Ensure the `/INT` line (GPIO40) is connected on the board; the timer IRQ is what paces those replayers. |
| UF2 not recognized | Not in BOOTSEL, or wrong file | Enter BOOTSEL and copy the UF2 again. |
| Name truncated in menu | Filename too long | Shorten the filename. |

## Known limitations

- Only one ROM per UF2 (use the MultiROM or Explorer tools for multiple titles).
- The `-s1`, `-m1`, and `-r1` options require a FAT-formatted microSD card in the cartridge's microSD slot.
- The `-s2`, `-m2`, and `-r2` options require a USB flash drive connected to the cartridge's USB-C port (via OTG adapter) for disk access.
- The `-w` option is available only with `-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, or `-m2`.
- `-w` requires an ESP-01 module and compatible ESP-side firmware; the PicoVerse firmware provides the ROM mapping and serial transport, not the ESP application layer itself.
- The `-m1` and `-m2` options provide 1MB mapper RAM (64 × 16KB pages) backed by external PSRAM on GPIO47 / QMI CS1.
- The `-r1` and `-r2` options provide that same 1MB mapper RAM plus a separate 1MB MegaRAM surface with 128 x 8KB banks, four visible windows in `0x4000`-`0xBFFF`, Cartucho II-compatible bank latches selected by address bits A14:A13, `IN (0x8E/0x8F)` write enable, and `OUT (0x8E/0x8F)` write disable.
- The `-c1` and `-c2` options reuse that same 1MB PSRAM-backed mapper RAM and expose it through Carnivore2-compatible RAM-mode behavior intended for `SROM.COM /D15`.
- The `-w` Sunrise IDE WiFi system-ROM option is not currently exposed in Explorer or the `-c1`/`-c2` Carnivore2 loader modes. MultiROM supports `-w` for `-s1`, `-m1`, `-s2`, and `-m2` Nextor entries. Explorer has its own built-in ESP-01 path for File Hunter browsing and WiFi setup.
- The `-c1` and `-c2` modes are loader modes, not direct ROM-embedding modes. They boot Nextor first; the ROM is uploaded later from DOS into PSRAM.
- SCC/SCC+ audio for `SROM.COM /D15` uploads is enabled by building the loader UF2 with `-c1/-c2` plus `-scc` or `-sccplus` before flashing the cartridge.
- Linux/macOS binaries are not provided (use Windows or build from source).
- The tool does not verify ROM integrity beyond size and mapper heuristics.
- SCC/SCC+ flags are applied for Konami SCC mapper (type 3) and Manbow2 mapper (type 14) ROMs; otherwise they are ignored with a warning.
- SCC/SCC+ emulation is available in the current RP2350 LoadROM package.
- The `-4` / `--opl4` OPL4 / MoonSound build is a standalone sound cartridge: it embeds no game ROM, ignores all other options, and overclocks the RP2350 to 300 MHz (282 MHz with `--lowclock`). It requires the I2S DAC and the `/INT` line (GPIO40) on the PicoVerse 2350 board.
- A few extreme-polyphony MoonSound songs exceed the real-time synthesis budget of the `ymfm` core at 44.1 kHz and can underrun; `--opl4-limit` trades some peak PCM polyphony for continuous playback on that material.
- The `-a` / `--msx-audio` MSX-AUDIO build is likewise a standalone sound cartridge: it embeds no game ROM, cannot be combined with `-4` or any other option except `-o` and `--4mhz`, occupies a whole slot, and requires the I2S DAC and the `/INT` line (GPIO40).
- In MSX-AUDIO mode the Philips NMS-1205 MIDI interface and the Music Module 8-bit DAC on port `0x0A` are not emulated, the Y8950 sound-enable pin is always on, the MSX-AUDIO keyboard reads back as "no keys pressed", and a second card on ports `0xC2`/`0xC3` is not decoded.
- Excessive flashing can wear out flash memory.

## Future improvements

- Cross-platform builds (Linux/macOS).
- Optional ROM integrity checks.
- GUI wrapper for mapper forcing.
- Additional mapper heuristics.
